            <p id="tribute-info" class="tribute-info">Women at that time were not allowed to formally attend university, but Kovalevskaya was allowed to audit mathematics classes at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. In 1874 she presented papers on topics such as partial differential equations, the dynamics of the rings of Saturn, and elliptic integrals. <strong>Kovalevskaya became the first woman in Europe to earn a doctorate in mathematics.</strong> She later secured a position at Stockholm University with the help of Swedish mathematician Gösta Mittag-Leffler, whom she met through his sister Anne Charlotte Leffler, a woman with whom she supposedly had an intimate “romantic friendship” that lasted until Kovalevskaya’s death from influenza at the age of 41.</p>

                    <li><strong>1870</strong>: Began to take private lessons with Karl Weierstrass, since the university would not allow her even to audit classes.</li>
                    <li><strong>1874</strong>: She presented three papers—on partial differential equations, on the dynamics of Saturn's rings, and on elliptic integrals—to the University of Göttingen as her doctoral dissertation.</li>
                    <li><strong>1878</strong>: Gave birth to her daughter.</li>
                    <li><strong>1883</strong>: Kovalevskaya became a privat-docent at Stockholm University in Sweden.</li>
                    <li><strong>1884</strong>: She was appointed to a five-year position as Extraordinary Professor, which would be assistant professor in modern terminology, and became an editor of Acta Mathematica.</li>
                    <li><strong>1888</strong>: Won the Prix Bordin of the French Academy of Science, for her work <em><span lang="fr">"Mémoire sur un cas particulier du problème de la rotation d'un corps pesant autour d'un point fixe, où l'intégration s'effectue à l'aide des fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps"</span></em>. Her submission featured the celebrated discovery of what is now known as the "Kovalevskaya top".</li>
                    <li><strong>1889</strong>: Kovalevskaya was appointed Ordinary Professor (full professor) at Stockholm University, the first woman in Europe in modern times to hold such a position.</li>
